 After a length of not less than 0.2D from the end of the keyway, the shaft diameter may be reduced to the diameter calculated for straight sections. 
 Fillet radii in the transverse section of the keyway are not to be less than 0.0125D.

Subject to limitations as slot length (â)/outside diameter < 0.8 and inner diameter (di)/outside diameter < 0.7 and slot width (e)/outside diameter > 0.15. The end rounding of the slot is not to be less than e/2. An edge rounding should preferably be avoided as this increases the stress concentration slightly.
The k and cK values are valid for 1, 2 and 3 slots, (i.e., with slots at 360 respectively 180, and respectively 120 degrees apart).

"Bore Sighting. The bore sighting procedure is to be conducted in two stages, as follows:


Bore sighting before bearings fitting (not applicable for stern tube bearings installed by resin chocking), is to be conducted on the stern tube bore to verify:

The stern tube bore dimensions; in order to define dimensions and tolerance for the aft and the forward stern tube bush outside diameters machining
The stern tube bore misalignment, vertical and horizontal; in order to define angular corrections for stern tube bearing outside diameter machining

Commentary:
Whenever applicable, corrections are recommended to be by machining the outside bush diameter, rather than correcting the stern tube bore.

End of Commentary




Bore sighting after the stern tube bearings are fitted, is to verify:

The aft bush slope, as-installed. The measurement is to be taken with reference to the forward stern tube bush.
The horizontal misalignment between aft and the forward stern tube bearing

In cases with no forward stern tube bearing, the intermediate shaft bearing is to serve as a reference point to conduct sighting.


Sufficient number of targets are to be utilized during the sighting through to establish accuracy in verification of bearing slopes. The sighting target arrangement is to be included in the procedure. See 4-3-2/Figures 8 and 9 for bore sighting methods.
The bore sighting is to confirm:


The horizontal misalignment of all bearings is to be minimized and is not to exceed the clearance of adjacent bearings.


The slope boring angle is to be verified relative to the centerline connecting the aft and the forward stern tube bearing, or the intermediate shaft bearing in installations with no forward stern tube bearing. Acceptable tolerance is up to Â±0.1*10-3 [rad], with the following restriction:

The measured slope boring angle is never to result in misalignment greater than 0.3*10-3 [rad].




FIGURE 8 Bore Sighting - Piano Wire (2024)



FIGURE 9 Bore Sighting - Optical Instrument & Laser (2024)





Installations with no Forward Stern Tube Bearing. The following requirements are to be fulfilled in installations with no forward stern tube bearings:


The aft stern tube bearing is to be of the double or multi-slope design that provides compliance with 4-3-2/7.3.3. 
Commentary:
A single slope design may be accepted where adequate technical documentation is submitted to justify that a single slope design provides an equivalent or better design.

End of Commentary



The aftmost intermediate shaft bearing is to serve as the second fixed point of reference when sighting is conducted.
The intermediate shaft bearing is to be chocked and its offset not changed after the bore sighting is complete, except as agreed to by the attending Surveyor based on the clearance measurements identified in 7.3.4 below or otherwise additional measurement and analysis demonstrating that the misalignment meets the criteria identified in 4-3-2/7.3.2(a)vi) are to be submitted for review.
The forced stern tube lubrication system is to be designed with the lubricant supply entering at the aft of the aft stern tube bearing.




Stern Tube Bearing Fitting Pressure Verification (if applicable) . The stern tube bearing fitting pressure is to be verified to comply with calculated values.





Tail Shaft Bearing Clearance Measurement. 
The clearance between the propeller shaft and the stern tube bearings is to be measured after the propeller shaft is fitted, before propeller is installed, and with shaft unrestrained on the forward flange. The attending Surveyor is to verify that the final alignment does not exceed the criteria identified in 4-3-2/7.3.4.i (4th bullet). 
Commentary:

The measurement results without the Surveyor's attendance may be accepted provided the measurement procedure is approved by the Surveyor prior to conducting the measurement on a case-by-case basis.

"If the calculated relative misalignment slope between the shaft and the tail shaft bearing is greater than 0.3*10-3 [rad], the relative misalignment slope is to be reduced by means of slope-boring or bearing inclination. See 4-3-2/Figure 7 for the illustration of relative misalignment.
The slope boring angle calculation (single, double or multi-slope) is to be based on a static afloat condition with a hot engine and fully immersed propeller. Also see 4-3-2/7.3.2(a).vi above.
The slope boring verification procedure is to be submitted for review.
An aft stern tube bearing double or multi-slope boring design with one or more transition points is to have the aftmost transition point between two or multi-slopes located in between D/3 and L/4 distance from the aft bearing edge.

Tail Shaft Bearing Clearance Calculation . A clearance calculation, on aft and forward stern tube bearing, with alignment model showing only the propeller shaft on two stern tube bearings, is to be included in the shaft alignment analysis report and submitted to ABS for review. In installations with no forward stern tube bearing, the clearance is to be calculated with the propeller shaft and the intermediate shaft connected including the intermediate shaft bearing or a temporary support utilized as a second support instead of the forward stern tube bearing. In both cases, the calculation is to be conducted with no propeller considered and with bearings modeled as multiple supporting points, which, as a minimum, are to include the forward and the aft edge of each bearing.
